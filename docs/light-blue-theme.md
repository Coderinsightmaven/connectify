# Light Blue Theme

## Overview

A new **Light Blue Theme** has been added to Connectify, providing a calming, modern interface with soft blue tones. This theme offers a fresh alternative to the standard light and dark themes.

## Features

### Color Palette
The light blue theme uses carefully selected OKLCH color values to ensure:
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios for text readability
- **Consistency**: Harmonious blue tones throughout the interface
- **Modern Feel**: Soft, calming colors that reduce eye strain

### Theme Colors
- **Background**: Light blue-tinted background (`oklch(0.97 0.013 225)`)
- **Primary**: Medium blue for buttons and accents (`oklch(0.55 0.18 225)`)
- **Secondary**: Subtle blue-gray for secondary elements
- **Text**: Dark blue-gray for optimal readability
- **Borders**: Light blue borders that complement the overall design

## Usage

### Theme Selection
Users can select the light blue theme through:

1. **Segmented Theme Toggle** (Settings → Appearance):
   - Grid layout with 4 options: Light, Blue, Dark, System
   - Visual icons for each theme (droplet for light blue)

2. **Icon Theme Toggle** (Header):
   - Cycles through all themes: Light → Blue → Dark → System
   - Shows current theme icon (droplet for light blue)

3. **Dropdown Theme Toggle**:
   - Full list with theme names and icons

### Theme Preview
The Settings → Appearance page includes:
- **Live Preview**: Shows how the current theme affects the interface
- **Sample Content**: Displays headers, posts, buttons, and interactions
- **Real-time Updates**: Preview changes instantly when switching themes

## Implementation

### CSS Variables
The theme is implemented using CSS custom properties:

```css
[data-theme="light-blue"] {
  --color-background: oklch(0.97 0.013 225);
  --color-primary: oklch(0.55 0.18 225);
  /* ... other color definitions */
}
```

### Icon
Added a new droplet icon (`Icons.droplet`) to represent the light blue theme:
- SVG-based for crisp rendering at any size
- Consistent with other theme icons (sun, moon, user)

### Components Updated
- `ThemeToggle`: Extended to support 4 themes with new layouts
- `Header`: Replaced custom toggle with unified ThemeToggle component
- `AppearanceSettings`: Enhanced with ThemePreview component
- `ThemeProvider`: Automatically supports the new theme value

## Technical Details

### Theme Switching
The theme toggle now supports cycling through multiple themes:
```typescript
const themes = ['light', 'light-blue', 'dark', 'system']
const currentIndex = themes.indexOf(theme || 'system')
const nextIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % themes.length
setTheme(themes[nextIndex])
```

### Responsive Layout
The segmented theme picker uses a responsive grid:
- **2x2 Grid**: Accommodates 4 theme options
- **Consistent Spacing**: Maintains visual balance
- **Touch-Friendly**: Adequate button sizes for mobile

## Benefits

1. **User Choice**: More options for personalizing the interface
2. **Accessibility**: Alternative color scheme for users who prefer blue tones
3. **Modern Design**: Contemporary color palette that feels fresh
4. **Consistency**: Maintains design language while offering variety
5. **Eye Comfort**: Softer blues can be easier on the eyes than stark whites

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for the light blue theme:
- **Customizable Blue Hues**: Allow users to adjust the blue tone
- **Automatic Time-Based Switching**: Blue theme during day hours
- **High Contrast Variant**: Enhanced contrast version for accessibility
- **Additional Blue Themes**: Multiple blue variations (navy, sky, teal)

The light blue theme demonstrates the platform's flexibility and commitment to user experience customization.
